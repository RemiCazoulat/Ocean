# Ocean
 Trying to do water simulation
## What is working
- moving and displaying vertices with shaders.
  
for now :
- creating 512 waves.
- creating 512 * 512 vertices.

- Water is blue, and the lambertian blur is nearly working.

## What are the next steps
- creating a texture that contains frequencies of the waves.
- making a inversed fast fourier transform to create waves from the texture.
- making beautiful light effect, foam...
- making boats float on it ?
