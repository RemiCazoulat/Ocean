# Ocean
 Trying to do water simulation
# What is working
moving and displaying vertices with shaders 
for now :
creating 512 waves
creating 512 * 512 vertices.

Water is blue, and the lambertian blur is nearly working

# What are the next steps
creating a texture that contains frequencies of the waves.
making a inversed fast fourier transform to create waves from the texture.
making beautiful light effect, foam...
making boats float on it ?
